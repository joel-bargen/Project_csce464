                <h1>Know Your Well - Senior Design</h1>
                <p>Every student in the School of Computing is required to complete at least two semesters of a senior design project, and I am assigned to work
                    on the Know Your Well project for the Nebraska Water Center. The goal is to create a way for high school students in the program to submit 
                    information they collected about wells and various other factors that need to be considered. This is the second year of the project, so this 
                    year's team took over a partially created application. This project is coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and the database is through Azure.
                </p>
                <p>Last year's team decided to create a PWA as the solution to the project parameters. This allowed for the application to used similarly through 
                    browsers regardless of what device is used. Though we took over an existing application, the product had a ways to go when we took over. At 
                    first, we mainly worked on debugging the current application as well as familiarizing ourselves with the code and project. After that, we began 
                    to start implimenting additional features that were requested by the sponsors. Since taking over, we have fully integrated the PWA with Nebraska 
                    Cloud which allows the students using the website to login using their own high school credentials. We are also currently working on adding offline 
                    functionality, an option to upload photos, and exportation of the data into a CSV file.

                <h1>Portfolio Website - CSCE464</h1>
                <p>This class is all about teaching how to create all the parts and functions that a website might have. Currently, I have built a portfolio type 
                    website that displays information about me, my resume, various information about projects, and how to contact me. I have also started to include 
                    a few simple games that I have made, like a number guessing game. The website you are viewing right now is the project I am speaking of, and you 
                    can also view the <a href="https://github.com/joel-bargen/project_csce464" target="_blank">Github</a> page where I have this project saved.
                </p>
                <p>Currently, I have built this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is all that is needed to fulfill the requirements for the mid-semester 
                    project submission, but the final submission will also include PHP and database interaction as well as some XML and React.

                <h1>Embedded Systems Robot - CSCE336</h1>
                <p>The final project for my embedded systems class was a semester long project and used a LAFVIN robot. Essentially, throughout the semester we were 
                    asked to assemble this robot piece by piece and enable it to have the functionality to move forward and around objects when they were detected. 
                </p>
                <p>Obviously, the first step was to assemble my robot physically. That meant taking the frame and adding the wheels, motors, various boards and other 
                    equipment, and wire it all so that the board could send out signals to the various parts to function. Once everything was connected properly, the 
                    next step was to create a program step by step so the robot, which I named Butter, could move through the obsticale course. The programming part 
                    was more difficult than assembling the physcial build. Essentially, I had to program Butter to use its ultrasonic sensor to continuously scan for 
                    obstacles and once it detected an obstacle in the immediate path, it had to adjust and go around the obstacle. Though this project was difficult, 
                    I greatly enjoyed it. A photo and video from my project can be found below.

                <h1>Sales System - CSCE156</h1>
                <p><strong>Project abstract: </strong>Modern Geek Games is in need of a technology overhaul. The company was recently purchased and the previous owner had 
                    no concrete sales system. The goal is to make a complete sales system using Java that is database-backed. In order to handle the current needs 
                    as well as bringing the previous information up to date the company will need to have file processing and reporting capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>For the project described above, we were required to complete it using Java with SQL functionality. It was also requried to include structures for 
                    the different sales items as well as including file processing and reporting functions. There will be structures for items, people, and stores as 
                    well as the sales data for each sale occurance. A function to process CSV files, parse them, and then output XML files for cross-system use was 
                    included.

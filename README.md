# CSCE 464 Project

The purpose of this website is to serve as a form of a virtual resume. This personal portfolio includes mulitple webpages including pages about me, my resume, various projects I have been apart of, simple games, and ways to contact me.

This website is structured using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The HTML is used as the base of the website, and the CSS is used to style the various HTML components. The Javascript is used to add more interactivity to my web portfolio, specifically in reference to the feedback form and simple games I have included on the website.

3/8/2024: This version of my project is made of HTML, CSS, and Javascript components. There are the requirements for the mid-semester project submission.

5/8/2024: After updating my project for the final submission of the 464 class, I have implemented a few portions of the code in PHP and included a database to store feedback. The major changes and added features for this final submission include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Creating and connecting a database to store feedback</li>
<li>Allowing for feedback to be downloaded using the users email</li>
<li>Creating a home page and moving the contact information to the footer</li>
<li>Added more photos and information to my projects page</li>
</ul>

# CSCE 464 Project

The purpose of this website is to serve as a form of a virtual resume. This personal portfolio includes mulitple webpages including pages about me, my resume, various projects I have been apart of, simple games, and ways to contact me.

This website is structured using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The HTML is used as the base of the website, and the CSS is used to style the various HTML components. The Javascript is used to add more interactivity to my web portfolio, specifically in reference to the feedback form and simple games I have included on the website.

3/8/2024: This version of my project is made of HTML, CSS, and Javascript components. There are the requirements for the mid-semester project submission.

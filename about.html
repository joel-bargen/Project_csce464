                <p>Hi, my name is Joel Bargen and I am currently a senior student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This May, I am planning on graduating with a
                    Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. As I currently reside in Lincoln, NE I am looking for potential job opportunities in the area,
                    mainly around Lincoln and Omaha. If you check out the <a href="./resume.html">Resume</a> page, you'll see that I have quite a bit of IT experience 
                    as most of my previous work has been IT internships. 
                </p>
                <p>Through my IT internships, I have learned the valuable skill of customer service which is helpful in any role, not just IT support. Through my 
                    internships I have also learned how to work as a team and help others as well as receive help when troubleshooting various issues that appear 
                    throughout the work day. While mainly assisting customers in-person, I have also had the chance to learn how to troubleshoot issues over the phone
                    to customers who work remotely. Specifically through my internship with Ameritas, I work on a team of interns that help support the full-time
                    IT support team. As I work on a team of interns, I have had the chance to help train the new members of the team. With this opportunity to helpful
                    train and lead the team of interns, I have been able to improve my ability to lead others as well as improve the skill of teaching others in 
                    the best and most efficient way possible.
                </p>

                <p>Originally, I am from Utica, NE which is roughly 45 minutes west of Lincoln. Utica is a really small town and so most of the jobs I had in high 
                    school involved field work of some kind, whether that be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detasseling" target="_blank">detasseling</a> 
                    or wokring as a field scout for a seed company or local agronomist. The high school I attended was also a fairly small school which allowed me
                    to be involved in mostly all of the available clubs and groups provided by the school. I was also very involved in sports as I played football,
                    basketball, and ran track in high school. In college, I have maintained my love of sports by participating on a few different intramural teams
                    and I have also been apart of the <a href="https://ieee.unl.edu/" target="_blank">UNL IEEE</a> club as well.

                <p>In my personal life, I'm a big sports fan, specifically football and basketball. My favorite sport to play has always been basketball but my favorite
                    sport to watch is football. As is expected, I am a huge Nebraska Cornhuskers fan, especially the Nebraska Football team and this year of course is
                    the year that they will get over the hump and make a bowl game. When I'm not watching or playing any sports, I enjoy being outside, reading
                    books, and spending time with family and friends.
